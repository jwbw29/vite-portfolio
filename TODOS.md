## ‚≠êÔ∏è FEATURES

- TODO Mobile Friendly UI
- TODO Create a `Project.jsx` component
  - create variables inside that will make it easier to add Projects in the future
  - will probably use a local data file and then transfer the object as a prop
- TODO Add mapping to `ProjectsPage.jsx` once a Project component is created

## üêû BUGS

- BUG `/projects` cannot be accessed on it's own. It can only be accessed by clicking "Projects" on the home page. If you go to `www.justin-byrd.com/projects` directly **OR** do a refresh while you're on `/projects`, you get a 404
